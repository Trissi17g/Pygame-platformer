# Pygame-platformer
This is a pygame platformer that just won't work

So there are a lot of things going on. I will guide you through that.
First of all you'll see 3 Folders (you can literally ignore the other files I just forgot to delete them),
I guess the folder code is quiet simple it just contains all the code. The folder graphics should also be simple
as it contains the graphics. The folder levels is a bit more comlicated, it contains my first 3 levels (0-2), 
the level data and the tile set. You shouldnt care about level data and tile set because its only for designing the levels.
The level folders (0-2) could be quiet more intresting because they conatin csv-files of the diffrent level layers, 
which contain numbers from -1 (meaning nothing) to number x. The number is x because it changes in an unpredictable way 
but the highest you'll see is 16. The delimiter is ",". 
I guess I said the most important things. I would be glad if you answer me on Stack Overflow. 

Thanks in advance,
Tristan!
